# Timing Comparisons

Compares the performance of nx-parallel and NetworkX algorithms with the help of heatmaps.

The `timing/` folder has two subfolders, each with a `timing_individual_function.py` and its corresponding heatmaps:  

- `new_heatmaps/` → new timing script + heatmaps  
- `old_heatmaps/` → old timing script + heatmaps
